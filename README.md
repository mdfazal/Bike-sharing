# ML-Bike-sharing
## Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Linear_regression (imported from scikit-learn library) has been used in the jupyter notebook.
### It looks like the temperatur is a decent indicator for the total number of users on a particular day.Therefore we are going to use these two indicators. I am using atemp in this case, which is just adjusted for feel.
<p> Later we have splitted the dataset into training set and test set. This project predicts the use of bike-sharing on a particular day. Open the notebook to know more and see the workflow.
  Also star the repo, fork it and play around by taking different indicators.</p>
